            <h1>Hi!</h1>
            <p>
              I'm a game programmer who is passionate about learning everything I can about game programming. I like trying to understand everything that goes on under the hood, even when using ready made engines like Unity or Unreal. I still have a long way to go, but I am enjoying the process every step of the way. I believe in writing code with good performance whenever possible, as providing the best experience for my users is a priority for me. I try to follow data-oriented programming principles in any projects I am a part of. If you are interested in anything I do: <a href="#">contact</a> me.
