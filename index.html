          <h1>Hi!</h1>
          <p>
            I'm a game programmer who is passionate about learning everything I can about game programming. I like to understand what goes on under the hood, even when using ready made engines like Unity or Unreal. I believe there are still many things to achieve in game development beyond what ready made engines are cabable of currently. I still have a long way to go on my journey to becoming what I want to be, but I am enjoying the process every step of the way!

            I am also one of the original co-founders of <a href="http://bitingmascot.com">Biting Mascot</a>.
